            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And becauſe to the rectifying the Air, the Clothes do in ſome meaſure contribute, defending the Body from it; for this purpoſe wear thoſe Clothes that be warm and dry; in the Winter get a Suit of Lamb-skin, Fox-skin, of a Marten, or Ermin; and for a good warm pair of Shoes, take the skin of an Hare, which is very good againſt the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and infirmneſs of the Hams; or elſe that of a Fox, which ſtrengthens all the Members: Some make their Clothes of Wool, Cotton, or Silk, for thoſe that are made of Linnen are leaſt of all warm.

               <p>BEcauſe Motion is not only requiſite to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Health, but alſo very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, towards a good habit of the Body; therefore after the Air, it remains to treat of Exerciſe, the which is a moſt powerful and prevalent thing to keep us in health, being that which purges and drives away the ſuperfluous Humours of the Body, which are in ſuch ſort diſſipated and diſſolved, that there is no longer need of Phyſick, where this is not wanting. There be many ſorts of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is the beſt which is not violent, as Walking, but is a regular motion of the Body, as being moſt kindly, and moſt agreeable to the Members; but that Motion which is cauſed in a Coach, in a Ship, on Horſe-back, or the like, is the leaſt wholſom. Some Exerciſes are ſtrong and weariſom, and others moderate, light and weak: The temperate Exerciſe is that which contributes much to the Health; for it corroborates the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Health, waſts the Superfluities, enlivens Youth, chears old Age, and hinders Fulneſs, fortifies the Senſes, renders the Body light and agile, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Nerves, and all the Joynts, for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Parts become more robuſt. This alſo conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates the Members, aids Digeſtion, keeps the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Body clear and open, ſo that the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Vapours of the Spirits may find a better and more free iſſue, the which are the chiefeſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

The light Exerciſes are Fiſhing, Fowling, and ſuch like Divertiſements, which chear the Mind; and as moderate and temperate Exerciſe does wonderfully contribute to the Health, ſo overmuch Idleneſs is very pernicious. Rubbings are alſo exceeding uſeful, for they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Humours from falling into the Joynts; and doing it in the right time, that is, when the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities ſhall be evaporated from the inward Parts, it helps Digeſtion, recreates the Body, and opens the Pores, whereby the moiſt Humours, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of the Body, obtain an eaſier paſſage: It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſwiftly draws the Blood to the outward Parts; it thickens the ſubtil Bodies, and attenuates the groſs, hardens the ſoft, and mollifies the hard, and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally confirms the natural heat. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Exerciſe reaches ſo far, as the Body can bear without growing too weary, that is, till you wax hot, having a freſh colour, and begin to ſweat; which ſo ſoon as you perceive, change your Cloaths, and dry well all the Members, and put on other Cloaths, and if there be any need, lye a little in Bed, and reſt your ſelf, till you ſhall be refreſhed, and recover new ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Now the time for Exerciſe is before Meals, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt evacuated the Excrements of the Belly, and of the Bladder; for it is uſually very bad, and deſtructive to thoſe who being but juſt riſen from Table, with their Stomach charged, venture on any Exerciſe. And as Motion and Exerciſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before Meals, is a great preſerver of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132688:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> Health, ſo if preſently after Meals, 'tis the ſource and original <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> divers Infirmities: Therefore let all Exerciſe be afore Meat, to which there ought at leaſt for ſome ſmall time to ſucceed a profound and quiet reſt, and remiſneſs of the Body; though from this Rule are excepted the Ruſticks and Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who by a continual cuſtom go to their Exerciſe, (and that without any hurt) as ſoon as the meat is out of their mouths; and herein is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the ſaying, That it is better to exerciſe the Body full than empty. After a violent Exerciſe, one ought to beware of catching cold; for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Exerciſe having opened the Pores of the Body, the cold eaſily enters therein, bringing along with it Catarrhs, and divers other Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Then in the morning having firſt gone to ſtool, the Friction or Rubbing is to follow, which muſt be performed on the extreameſt or fartheſt Parts of the Body, beginning at the Knees, and proceed down to the ends of the Feet; then from the Thighs, bending at the Knees; then from the upper Ribs to the lower; then from the Shoulders down the Back; and laſtly, from the Arms to the Hands: And this to be done with a Napkin or Towel, lightly rubbing your Body, till the skin wax ſomething red. In old Men the motion of their ſuperiour Members, as the Arms and the Shoulders, is moſt neceſſary, becauſe it diverts and prohibits the Humours from falling into the lower Parts. And on the contrary, the rubbing Exerciſe of the Feet, or the waſhing them with Water alone, does accelerate and haſten the Gout in old Men: When it being requiſite that they ſhould ſometimes waſh their Feet, let them take weak Lye, wherein let there be boyled red Roſes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:132688:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> and a little Salt; in this let them waſh their Feet, at ſuch time as the Fits of the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t be not upon them. Likewiſe it would be good for them to pull off their Shoos and Stockings themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of their Servants, which things mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately exerciſe the Body, and ſtir up the Heat and Spirits. And by the way, I cannot but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve of the binding the Stockings with the Garters; 'tis rather far more commodious and wholſom, to wear Drawers and Stockings of one entire piece; for binding the Legs hard, cauſes ſeveral pains, and hinders the Heat, Blood and Spirits, from circulating and deſcending into the Joynts, whence they are weakned, and apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive divers Diſtempers. Furthermore, it is very profitable in Coughing, to ſpit, and caſt out the Excrements of the Body: Beſides this, before any Exerciſe, in the Morning as ſoon as you are up, rub well your Head, and comb it with an ivory Comb, from the Forehead upwards to the Crown, giving it at leaſt forty Combs; then with a rough Cloath, or a Sponge, rubbing your Head, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels all the Superfluities which are there lodged; for thereby the Spirits are rarified, and the paſſages of the Head opened, and the ſmoaky Vapours are more freely evacuated: Which thing corroborates all the interior Faculties, that is, the thinking, the imaginative Vertues, and the Memory; and the uſe of a Comb does wonderfully reſtore the Sight, eſpecially in the mean time looking in a Glaſs, the which excites all the animal Vertues, chiefly the Sight; and the combing the Head oftentimes a day, draws the Vapours to the upper Parts, and eaſily removes them from the Eyes; but in comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do not keep the Head too open. Then with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132688:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> another Comb, comb the Beard, the which cut often, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> chears, and cauſes a readineſs of Mind. It is expedient likewiſe to ſneeze, after this univerſal Evacuation, ſnuffing up into the Noſe a little powder of Pepper, or other Snuff. Laſtly, 'tis a neceſſary thing to waſh the Face and Hands, according to this rhiming or Leonine Verſe,
<q>Si fore vis ſanus, ablue ſaepe manus.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The waſhing the Face refreſhes a Man, and makes the Heat to retire by Antipariſtaſin, and then uniting it ſelf, it becomes more ſtrong. In the Winter waſh with the decoction of Sage, or Roſemary, ſometime ſteeped in Wine; in the Summer freſh Water is moſt agreeable, whereto add a little Roſe water, with a little Soap, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a perfumed Waſh-ball. The Hands ought to be often waſhed, for they are the Inſtruments which keep clean the Organs, whereby the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of the Brain iſſue forth, as are the Ears, the Eyes, and the Noſtrils; and therefore is ſaid,
<q>
                     <l>Lotio poſt menſam tibi confert munera bina,</l>
                     <l>Mundificat palmas, &amp; lumina reddit acuta.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But after Meals you ſhould not waſh the Hands with hot Water, for it breeds Worms in the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the reaſon is this, becauſe the hot Water does extract and draw forth the natural Heat, whence it happens, that digeſtion and concoction of the Food becomes imperfect, the which is a powerful occaſion of the Worms. The Eyes alſo are to be waſhed with freſh Water, which cleanſes them from all Gum and Filth; and putting the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:132688:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> Eyes into cool freſh Water open, does wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully clear and purifie the Eye-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ht, afterwards drying them with a very clean and perfum'd Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Take care alſo that your Teeth be very clean, which for want of well rubbing and cleanſing, cauſe a naughty and ſtinking Breath, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the Teeth being mixed with the Food, does breed corruption, and renders it putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Beſides which, the rotten Teeth do ſend to the Brain an infectious Vapour; and nothing is better to keep the Teeth white and clean, than to waſh them twice a Month with Wine, wherein let there be boyled a Root of Tithymalus, or Spurge. And now to waſh the Head ſometimes, we ought not to take that old <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb or Sentence for our Guide, <hi>viz. Si lavano ſpeſſo le mani, raro i pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, et non mai il capo:</hi> That is, we muſt often waſh our Hands, ſeldom our Feet, and never our Head. But that Maxim is not good; for waſhing the Head ſometimes does greatly ſtrengthen the Brain, eſpecially if in the Winter-time you waſh it with ſweet Lye, wherein let there be boyled ſome Sage, Bettony, Staechas, or French-Lavender, Camomil, Myrrh, and a little odoriferous Wine; and uſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Waſh-balls made of the Soap of Venice, or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, about two ounces of the Larch-tree, or Agaricon, (a kind of Muſhroom growing upon high Teees of a white colour, very good for the Head) one ounce; of Ladanum, three drams, of Cloves and Spikenard, <hi>ana</hi> two ſcruples, with oyl of Myrtles, and with theſe Ingredients make a little Ball for your uſe. In the Summer boyl with your Lye dry Roſes, and inſtead of the Soap, take the yelk of an Egg freſh and lukewarm. Having waſhed the Head, your next care muſt be to dry
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:132688:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> it as ſoon as you can with warm Cloaths, ſo that there remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wetneſs or moiſture, for the Brain is naturally moſt humid, and therefore Nature has given it ſo many vents and paſſages, whereby it may evacuate all the moiſt ſuperfluities. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when you have waſhed your Head, you ſhould beware of expoſing it too ſoon to the open Air, and therefore 'tis better to waſh it in the Evening before Supper; but firſt of all you ought to ſeek God's aſſiſtance by Prayer, who is the moſt skilful Phyſician both of Body and Soul, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his gracious and benign influence all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are vain and uſeleſs. Then going abroad, begin ſome eaſie, pleaſant Exerciſe, till you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a moderate ſweat ſpread it ſelf over all your Body; the moſt robuſt Exerciſe is rather to be performed in the Morning, than After-noon: And here it is worth your Obſervation, that as a temperate uſe of Exerciſe does mightily aid and contribute to the preſervation of the Health, ſo over-much is very deſtructive to the Health; and ſo as Motion before Meals is very neceſſary and wholſom, ſo if done immediately after Meals, draws the Humours through all the parts of the Body, and the juice which remains as yet raw in the Stomack; whence proceed divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Infirmities.</p>
               <p>After Dinner therefore no Exerciſe is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but a quiet compoſure and ſtilneſs of the Body is moſt requiſite, eſpecially for one hour after Dinner, after which a little walking is not amiſs, for the better digeſting and jogging down the Victuals to the bottom of the Stomack. Laſtly, thoſe Exerciſes are beſt which are performed in the open Air, rather than in Houſes; in the Sun,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132688:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> than in the Shade; and in the ſhade, either of a Wall, or of ſweet ſmelling Arb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rs, are more beneficial, than under any roofed place. Thoſe that by ſome Accident or other cannot walk, let them ride in a Horſe-Litter, in a Coach, or Sedan, ſo that they may in ſome manner have exerciſed themſelves before Meals; for by Idleneſs the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is dulled and blunted, but by Motion it is enlivened, and receives a better Appetite to its Victuals. Therefore the Body being ſufficiently exerciſed, repoſe your ſelf, to the end that the perturbation ceaſing, the Heat and the Blood are recreated (then you may venture to eat) which whileſt they are in revolution, draw the crude Humours to the Bowels, which do thereby remain very much obſtructed. Beſides this, we ought not to neglect the Exerciſe of the Mind; for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS an immoderate Exetciſe does very much endamage the Health, ſo on the other ſide does Idleneſs and over-much Reſt, which does not only offend the Body, but alſo weakens the Underſtanding; for whileſt the Body is in Idleneſs and without Action, it collects many ſuperfluities, whence afterwards infinite Diſtempers ariſe by Crudities, Obſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Idleneſs conſumes and corrupts the Strength, extinguiſhes the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat, and increaſes the Flegm in the Veins, fattens the Body, and weakens it. Alſo as by Exerciſe the Natural heat is increaſed, and the Concoction of the Food is facilitated, ſo by Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 'tis hindred and extinguiſhed; and for this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132688:14"/> reaſon Idleneſs is numbred amongſt the chief cauſes of cold Diſeaſes; and the Poet knowing how hurtful to the Health is Idleneſs, ſays,
<q>
                     <l>Cernis ut ignavum corrumpunt otia corpus.</l>
                     <l>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t capiunt vitium, ni moveantur aquae.</l>
                  </q> And Idleneſs not only corrupts the Body, but is alſo a great cauſe of pernicious Thoughts, as the ſame Poet ſays:
<q>
                     <l>Queritur Aegeſtus, quare ſit factus adulter,</l>
                     <l>In promptu cauſa eſt, deſidioſus erat.</l>
                  </q> However by moderate ſeaſonable Repoſe the Body and Mind are recreated and refreſhed; for,
<q>
                     <l>Quod caret alterna requie durabile non eſt,</l>
                     <l>Haec reparat vires feſſaque membra levat.</l>
                  </q> And Reſt not only to the Body, but alſo to the Mind, is ſometimes abſolutely neceſſary, when they are tyred with Studies, Thoughts, or Actions; according to another Poet,
<q>Otia Corpus alunt animus quoque paſcitur illis.</q> In brief, without Reſt, the ſtrength and vigour of the Mind, cannot long endure; whereas on the contrary, Reſt and Repoſe does in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure aid and contribute to the Speculation, and the profound Invention of Occult things. Reſt is good after Meals, becauſe the Victuals reſide in the bottom of the Stomack well united and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132688:14"/> coagulated, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ich always happens after a good Digeſtion. And as to the Flegmatick, and thoſe of a cold and moiſt Complexion, Motion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; ſo to the hot and cholerick, Reſt is moſt neceſſary. Though it is true, that too much Reſt, called Idleneſs, as is ſaid before, is exceedingly deſtructive, both to the Body and Mind, but eſpecially to the Mind; for it makes Men negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſlothful, ignorant, oblivious, and forgetful, and renders them unfit for any Counſel, Office, or Charge in the Republick. Then the Idleneſs alſo of the Body makes Men fat, lazy, ſluggards, weak, and of a pale Complexion, cools and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes their Natural Heat, increaſes Phlegm, and fills the Body with ſuperfluities, begetting cold Infirmities, as the Gout both in the Hands and Feet, Catarrhs, Obſtructions of the Bowels, Epilepſie, or Falling-Sickneſs, and pains of the Arteries; therefore when at any time you are neceſſitated to be in Idleneſs, and by ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or incumbrance you are forced to abſtain from all manner of Exerciſe, you muſt inſtead thereof obſerve a ſlender Diet, and that Food which is moſt eaſie of Digeſtion, and Broths, which without any trouble or difficulty are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and diſtributed through all the Body, and cauſe a lubricity, or ſlipperineſs in the Belly: And thoſe that make uſe of this Method, are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, that they do not lye along, or lean on one ſide, but for the moſt part to ſit upright, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Victu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
               <p>Now, the ſuperfluous Reſt is no ſmall hurt to the Body, therefore I adviſe you, that this Reſt be temperate, and not degenerate into a baſe ſloath and lazineſs, to which in a ſmall time ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Infirmity will ſucceed; whence we ſee thoſe that are in Priſon, loaded with Chains and Irons, ſo that they cannot move, always incur ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; for their Body grows cold, whileſt by the ſuperfluous moiſture the heat is ſuppreſſed, not being able freely to diſperſe it ſelf through the Body, the paſſages not only for the heat being ſtopped and hindred, but alſo for the Victuals; whence proceeds the diminution of the ſtrength, and the Members become leſſened, and almoſt dryed up. And on the contrary, a temperate and moderate Exerciſe diſſolves all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, and opens the ways and paſſages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Natural heat may without intterruption diffuſe and ſpread abroad it ſelf. And therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, that a moderate Exerciſe is above all things moſt neceſſary to Phlegmaticks, and to thoſe whoſe Conſtitution or Temper is cold and moiſt; but to hot and cholerick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Reſt (though not Idleneſs) is very fit and commodious: But beſides this, all Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians agree, that both Exerciſe and Reſt, if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, is a ſpecial means to preſerve the Health, and prolong the Life.</p>

               <p>ALL Creatures by long fatigues and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do waſte and conſume themſelves, and therefore ſtand in need of an alternate radical moiſtneſs, to ſupply the place of that which is ſpent, and to renew the weakned Spirits: Now, this is brought to paſs by moderate ſleeping, the commodity and good whereof is, that it re-heats and corroborates the Members, concocts the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, augments the Natural Heat, fattens the Body, heals the Infirmities of the Mind, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates and allays the troubles and ſorrows of the Heart; for whileſt we ſleep, the faculties of the Mind reſt and repoſe themſelves, and Nature ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates more ſtrongly. Sleep alſo facilitates the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Food, which lies in the Stomack, and not only concocts it there, but alſo diſtributes it through the parts of the Body; for the Natural heat concenters in the inward parts, whereby the Food is the better concocted. Laſtly, ſleep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all laſſitude and wearineſs, cauſed by over-much Watching, and therefore 'tis called a Reſt from all Labour, and the peace of the Mind, as is manifeſted in theſe Verſes:

                  </gap>nicious, than the other good and commodious; for it chills and dries the Body, weakens the Natural heat, and breeds Phlegmatick Humours, whence afterwards proceeds much ſloath and lazineſs, and it ſends many Vapours to the Head, which are oftentimes the immediate cauſe of Rheums and Catarrhs, and is very deſtructive to groſs and fat Bodies; in brief, 'tis neither good for the Body, nor the Mind, nor for Buſineſs; he who ſleeps too much, is but half a Man, ſleep rendring him in all points like a dead Man, except his digeſtion of the Food; for he neither ſees, nor hears, nor ſpeaks, nor underſtands, and is abſolutely deprived of all Reaſon, the which for the time is a perfect death. Superfluous ſleep moreover, both in ſound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Bodies, does beget an Aſthma, or ſhortneſs of Breath, and is the conſtant fore-runner and preparative to an Apoplexy, Palſie, Numbneſs, or Lethargy, and to a Fever; and beſides thoſe other incommodities which it brings along with it, it hinders the timely evacuation of the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cauſing them to remain longer in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or Guts. Sleep ought to be taken at ſuch time as the Stomack is free from all ſmoaky Food, the Vapours whereof arriving to the Brain, and finding it cold and thick, are congealed and made heavy; and then falling down, they obſtruct the ſenſitive paſſages of the Members, juſt as the Rain is formed in the middle Region of the Air, by the Vapours from the Earth. Now, on the contrary, too much watching, and want of ſleep, beget over-much heat in the Brain, and is the cauſe of the Anguiſh of the Mind, and of a bad
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:132688:16"/> Digeſtion of the Food; for by Watching the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

For the Soul ſerves the Body whileſt we ſee and move; and being divided into many parts, is not free, but diſtributes ſome part of it ſelf to all the Members and Senſes of the Body; to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the Sight, to the Feeling, to the Taſte, to the Walking, to the Working, and to every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Body; whence being altogether ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and employed by ſo many buſineſſes, it leaves the Food in the Stomack; and hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the Crudities, if Nature does not ſuccour and prevent them by neceſſary ſleep, the which is the Reſt and ſweet Repoſe of the Animal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. Sleep is good for Phlegmetick Perſons, becauſe it concocts the crude Humours, whence afterwards is begot good Blood, whereby a Man becomes more warm, the Natural heat being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the plenty of Blood. Sleep moreover is very uſeful in Cholerick Perſons, both as to the quiet of the Mind, and as to the correcting the Complexion of their Body. But it is moſt of all requiſite in Melancholy Men, ſeeing that it is ſleep alone can change their Diſtemper; for by ſleep they acquire a competent ſtock of heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, things that are very contrary to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. But it is moſt of all hurtful to thoſe of Sanguine Complexion. However, ſleep in the day-time, and after Dinner, is to be avoided by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But if any neceſſity (as is ſaid) compels a man to ſleep in the day time, either by reaſon of night-watching, or to reſtore decayed ſtrength, he may venture to ſleep a little in the day-time, for the heat being withdrawn to the inward Parts, cauſes a better Concoction. But one may ſleep in the long days ſitting on a leather Chair, with the Head lifted up, but not bowed backwards or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but on one ſide, which thing cauſes leſs Evaporation to the Brain; but ft is not good to ſleep in a ſoft and delicious Bed, nor perfumed with Musk, or Amber, or Lignum Aloes, becauſe there is too much ado, eſpecially when no good but rather hurt proceeds from thence, for it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the Brain, and makes the Head heavy: One ought alſo to avoid the contrary extream, and not to ſleep upon Boards, or other hard things, which will break ſome Vein in the Breaſt.</p>

                  </gap>fter, and the longer the better, for thereby the Victuals will be the better concocted. 'Tis yet more pernicious to ſleep immediately after Dinner than after Supper, for then a man is wakened out of his Sleep before that his Head can concoct, or diſpoſe of the Vapours which ariſe from his Food. 'Tis furthermore noxious to ſleep with an empty Stomach, becauſe it weakens the force of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and in ſleeping you ſhould not make too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turns, for it cauſes the corruption of the Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in the Stomach, increaſes the Superfluities, and laſtly, hinders the digeſtion of thoſe matters, and the ſending of them to their natural Places. So likewiſe ſleeping with the Face upwards is greatly to be avoided, for it offends the Back and the Reins, hinders the Breathing, and is a Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to the noxious diſtempers of the Nerves, or Sinews; for the Superfluities go to the nape of the Neck and Back-bone, and to the back-Parts, ſo that they cannot be purged out by the Noſe, nor the Mouth, nor by the other uſual means, though it is true, that when we be troubled with any pain or infirmity of the Reins, 'tis beſt to ſleep on the Back. The manner of Sleeping, to the end that Victuals may better deſcend to the bottom of the Stomach, is to begin your Sleep on the right ſide, continuing ſo the ſpace of two hours; then to turn your ſelf on the left ſide for a longer ſpace, which mightily aids Digeſtion; for then the Liver
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132688:18"/> embraces the Victuals, as a Hen her Chickens, and lyes directly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But when the Stomach is weak, the which you may know by the coldneſs which is perceived in its region, by all the ſharp and ſowr Humours, and by the Spittle after the Food, which is inſipid, and without taſte, then it is better to begin your Sleep lying on your Belly, for ſuch Sleep corroborates the Face, the Breaſt, and the Digeſtion; though it is naught for them who are troubled with Rheums in the Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it adds more Matter and Humours thereto: But at ſuch time 'twill be better to apply to the Stomach a Pillow of ſoft Feathers and little, ſuch as thoſe of a Vulture; or inſtead of Feathers, you may fill the Pillow with the clippings of Scarlet. And amongſt the things, which do moſtly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the expulſion of that coldneſs of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, is to hold embraced a fleſhy Child, or a little fat Dog, which heating the Stomach do greatly aid Digeſtion. The quantity of Sleep ought to be taken till the Concoction in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is perfected, which may be known by the Urine, which when it looks clear as Water, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Signs of a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sleep is a Lightneſs and Agility, which ſpreads it ſelf over all the Body, and chiefly in the Brain, and the deſcent of the Food from the Stomach, and a deſire to eaſe Nature, both of it and of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and a ceſſation of the wearineſs, cauſed by the fore-paſt waking; whereas the contrary Signs, that is, a heavineſs of the Body, and Belches, which ſavour of the Victuals, ſignifie that more Sleep is required, the other not being ſufficient. And you muſt know in brief, that a moderate Sleep reſtores the animal Faculties, helps the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of the Victuals, and of the crude Humours, cauſes a forgetfulneſs of Labour, and all ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts, mitigates the grief of the Mind, moiſtens all the Members of the Body, reſtores all the waſted Faculties, augments the natural Heat, increaſes the radical Moiſture, clarifies and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Sight, takes away Wearineſs, refreſhing the tired Bodies, and keeps back Fluxes and Rheums.

               <p>FRom the eating of Food are collected many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, of which a great part is ſpent and conſumed, (as we have ſhewed in its place) by Exerciſe; it is neceſſary therefore by ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to drive the remnant out of the Body. Now theſe Superfluities be divers, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Places whence they proceed, as Spittle, Snot, Sweat, Urine, dregs of the Belly, and other ſordities or filthineſs of the Body, which if not driven out, are wont to beget many Infirmities, as Obſtructions, Feavers, Pains, and Impoſtumes; for which reaſon we ought with all diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Evacuation, for all thoſe Diſtempers which proceed from Fulneſs, are cured by Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; as on the contrary, thoſe which are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Emptineſs, are cured by Fulneſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuperfluous Evacuation is to be forbidden, for by it the natural Heat and the Spirits are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, for then their vertues are not powerful

We muſt therefore chiefly advertiſe you, that the Superfluities and Excrements of the Belly, and the Urine, every day morning and evening, or at leaſt once a day be evacuated, for it is very neceſſary for ones health to keep the Body looſe; and this is moſt profitable in the pains of the Gout, Stone, or Gravel in the Kidneys. This is done either by Art or Nature, with common Glyſters, or with Oyl alone, or with a Suppoſitory of Honey or Salt, of Butter, or of Soap; and you muſt not ſuffer theſe Superfluities to remain too long in the Belly, for they are very deſtructive both to the Head, and to all the Body. Every time therefore that a man ſhall perceive any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs in his Entrails, or in the Bladder, or in any other Place where the Superfluities are gathered together; and every time that he thinks there is a neceſſity thereof, let him ſuddenly excite Nature, and ſtir up a deſire of ſending it forth; for we ſee in many, that having for ſome time retained their Urine, they could not afterwards make Water, and have cauſed the Stone, Ruptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the keeping back of the Excrements, or the Wind, have occaſioned Cholick pains: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Schola Salerni</hi> thus ſpeaks thereof;

               <p>We ought with all our might to avoid the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous repletion of Victuals and Drink, becauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132688:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> they beget and foment many Evils, for from the overmuch Fulneſs, the natural faculties in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach are weakned and oppreſſed, as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary being empty, it cauſes the Falling-ſickneſs. The Veſſels when they are too full of Meats and Drinks, are in great danger either that they burſt, or at leaſt the natural heat is thereby ſuffocated; and in fat and big Bodies, a moderate abſtinence is very neceſſary; and therefore the Gluttons do not grow at all, becauſe their Meat does not digeſt it ſelf, whence the Body is not nouriſhed: And therefore the Philoſopher being asked, <hi>Why he did eat ſo little;</hi> anſwered, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t vivam edo, non ut edam vivo:</hi> Or according to the Italian Proverb, which is,

If therefore at any time by a diſordinate and irregular Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, you ſhould chance to over-eat your ſelf, and that you perceive a nauſeating and heavineſs in the Stomach, which is occaſioned either by the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or quantity of the Food, then preſently endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to vomit it forth, the which cleanſes the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>FRictions or Rubbings are very uſeful for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Health, and chiefly for old men; and the operation and effects which proceed from thence are very great; for they hinder that the Humours do not fall into the Joynts, and help Digeſtion, and if performed in due time, (that is, having firſt eaſed the Body of its Excrements) chears the Body, opens the Pores, whereby the Superfluities are more eaſily evaporated, becauſe it ſwiftly draws the Blood to the exterior Parts, thickens the ſlender Bodies, and attenuates the big, mollifies the hard, and hardens the ſoft, and finally kindles and corroborates the natural Heat, and excites the vital Faculties, whence the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution and concoction of the Food is more eaſie and ready: And the Rubbing ought to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until it ſhall become delightful and pleaſant; and 'tis very convenient for old men in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Autumn, if they firſt void the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the Bladder and Belly; if old men by reaſon of their weakneſs or ſome occupation, cannot perform any Exerciſe, inſtead thereof let them uſe ſhort and moderate Rubbing, as is ſaid before.</p>

               <p>THE Paſſions of the Mind have great power, and do much contribute to the changing of the Body, becauſe they make a ſtirring and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Humours, and in the Spirits, and theſe motions immoderate and ſudden are raiſed from the Center of the Body to the Circumference; as Anger, Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or from the Circumference to the Center, as Fear, and the like, from whence proceed great motions of the Spirits; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought carefully to avoid ſuch Paſſions, ſince it dries the Body, and alters it too much, troubling it, and changing it from its Natural Complexion; and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calls theſe the Infirmities of the Mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Anger, Joy, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Melancholy, Anxiety, or Anguiſh, Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Fury, Violence, Brawling, Contention, Hatred, Envy, Perplexity, Fear, Shame, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant Thoughts, unbridled Deſires, Boldneſs, Incontinence, Importunity, Iniquity, Ambition, Diſtruſt, Hope, Deſpair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which Paſſions, beſides the great hurt they do to the Body, do alſo very much offend the Mind; for Anger, and over-much Sorrow afflict the Spirits, dry the Bones, extenuate the Fleſh, inflame and burn the Body, putting it into confuſion out of its natural ſtate; whence afterwards proceed many evils; as Catarrhs, and Fluxes in the Joynts, although theſe Paſſions when they are moderate, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132688:24"/> good for Men, and does not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their Health. For Example, Anger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites and increaſes the Natural heat, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is good to be Angry, to repair that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, and to collect the Blood in the Veins; and therefore in cold Infirmities Anger is to be ſtirred up, as on the contrary, in hot it is to be avoided. Beſides this, the Paſſion of the Mind, to wit, Melancholy, weakens the Digeſtion, whereas Joy and Gladneſs fortifies it. And this is the chiefeſt and trueſt Reaſon why Men, more than all other Creatures are expoſed to Crudities, becauſe the Beaſts and irrational Animals, although they eat to ſatiety, nevertheleſs do not hinder the Natural Virtue which concocts the Food; for the concoctive virtue and the appetitive is equal in them; but Men by their divers thoughts and perturbations of their Mind, divert this Virtue from its Operation; and though they eat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, yet they fall into Crudities, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed many Infirmities; and therefore a Man by all poſſible means to avoid the thoughts of ſad and dolorous ſubjects, and all other things which may any wiſe diſturb the Mind, and always to hope well of every thing; for to have a chearful Mind in all Infirmities is good, whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is as bad; neither is it good a long while to dwell upon Thoughts, for it is ſaid, <hi>L' Imaginatione fa il caſo.</hi> You muſt keep your ſelf alſo from frequent weeping, from great fury, and from an appetite or deſire of Revenge; for theſe things weaken the Brain, and hinder the digeſtion of the Matter; ſo alſo ſuperfluous Fear weakens the Virtues: And all theſe Accidents of the Mind hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concoction, and alter the natural ſtate of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132688:24"/> Body. For Fear withdraws the Spirits and the Blood, attracting them inwardly to the Heart, whence the Members grow cold, the Body pale, cauſing tremblings, the Voice is interrupted, and the whole force of the Body is deficient; for Fear, whileſt the Evil feared is expected, cauſes a beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Heart, which cauſes a commotion of the Spirits, the which being moved, diſturb all the Blood; whence afterwards are occaſioned Crudities and Putrefactions. Anger is a vehement mover of Heat, which pours out it ſelf in the outward parts with great violence; and therefore with Anger the Face looks red, and the Body is more apt to all Wickedneſs: Anger furthermore moves the Heart to Revenge, the which moved, eaſily inflames the Body, and dry it, and by its fervour all the Faculties of the Soul are confounded; and therefore 'tis ſaid, Anger is an inflammation of the Blood about the Midriff, by reaſon of a deſire of Revenge; and therefore thoſe that be Angry, have a ſtrong and big pulſe, whereas the fearful have a ſmall and weak, becauſe the Heat returns inward. But in theſe caſes, the Natural heat one while retires within, another while outwards, both one and the other of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſcover themſelves in ſhame, that firſt the heat retreats within, afterwards comes out, which not returning, cauſes fear, and not ſhame. If after thoſe things which a Man ſuddenly ſuffers, if then he grows paſſionate, by little and little 'twill cauſe ſorrow, which ſpoils and corrupts the Nature of Men, exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132688:25"/> by theſe ſudden motions of the Mind is cauſed ſudden Death; for either the Faculties of the Mind (which conſiſt in heat) are diſſolved, or elſe are extinguiſhed by too much cold: And there are many who have periſhed by over-much fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We read likewiſe that many by an exceſs of Joy have died, as alſo by ſudden grief or fear, though never any by too much Anger. By a great and ſudden Joy the Animal Spirits being looſned, are tranſported to the external parts, and diſſolve themſelves; and thence the Heart being forſaken and deſtitute of the Blood and Spirits, grows cold, whereby many, eſpecially thoſe that are very timerous and cowardly, have loſt their Lives. Many others moreover, have died of ſhame, as is read of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Diodorus;</hi> for which cauſe theſe Paſſions of the Mind ought always to be uſed with a certain Mediocrity, or Moderateneſs; and chiefly Joy ought to be accompanied with a moderate Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which thing excites the Natural heat, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates and purifies all the Animal Spirits, corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the other Faculties, aids Digeſtion, clears and ſubtilates the Wit, and renders a Man able for all Buſineſſes, preſerves Youth, and finally prolongs the Life; and Joy is good for all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, except ſuch as have need to become lean, becauſe it fattens the Body, and multiplies the fleſh and moiſture. In ſhort, nothing is more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132688:25"/> neceſſary for the conſervation of the Heart, than to live gladly and merrily; not to trouble ones ſelf, or be angry, always to have a good hope of Health, let all theſe things be done moderately, for Mediocrity ought always to be your aim; and therefore ſays <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> let your cares and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, your eating and drinking, ſleep, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Pleaſures, let all theſe things be moderate: for,

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Meat and Drink.</head>
               <p>FInally, towards the preſervation of the Health of Humane Bodies, Meat and Drink are the principal Inſtruments, becauſe without it neither healthy nor unhealthy, diſtempered nor indiſtempered, are able to live; therefore there is no queſtion but that the uſe of Food is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; for our Bodies being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Flux, which every hour, and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time does conſume and diſſolve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Body, and likewiſe the Humours and the ſolid parts, if another like ſubſtance inſtead of that which is diſſolved, is not introduced, Death will in a ſhort while follow thereupon; to ſupply which defect, the Almighty Creator of all things, by his great Benevolence has provided for Men Meats and Drinks; and to the end, that by Food may be reſtored all that which was waſted from the more dry ſubſtance; and with Drinks, all that was diminiſhed from the Humid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In Food therefore it is conſidered the goodneſs, the quantity, the cuſtom, the choice, the order, the time, the nature, the place, and the Age.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore the Goodneſs; and therefore that is good Food which is light, and of ſubtil Digeſtion, eaſily concocted, and in a ſhort time deſcends from the Stomack, and is of good Juice; that Food is of good Juice which begets good
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132688:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> Blood, and good Blood is that which is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the firſt Degree, not too thin nor too thick; not ſharp nor biting, not bitter, not ſalt, nor ſour: The good Food is that which is eaſily digeſted, and ſuch are thoſe that have a tender ſubſtance, and are eaſily diſſolved, as Eggs, fleſh of ſmall Birds, to wit, of Pheaſants, Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thoſe Foods are of a difficult digeſtion which have a contrary ſubſtance, ſuch as are Foods made of Paſte or Dough, unleavened or hard Bread, Coleworts, Old Cheeſe, Beans, Lupins, Garlick, Onions, and the Entrails of Birds or Beaſts, ſuch things are to be avoided. Chooſe therefore thoſe Foods which with their wholſom and laudable Juice reſtore the radical Moiſture; or elſe let them not be groſs and excrementious: For the Natural Heat, if weak, eſpecially of Old Men, cannot digeſt Meats of an heavy and groſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and on the other ſide, let not the Meat be weak, that is, of ſmall Nouriſhment; for ſuch cauſe a ſhortneſs and diminution of our Lives.</p>
               <p>The Quantity of Foods is corrupted by the abundance of it; for ſo much Food ought to be taken, as the ſtrength can conveniently bear; that is, whereby it may be reſtored, and not over-loaden or preſt down, and that may be eaſily digeſted; for the Natural heat being weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, it cannot be concocted, and thereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low many Diſtempers; and therefore 'tis ſaid, thoſe that eat large Meals ought not to be merry and jocond; for though they do not find the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment thereof at preſent, yet they can never long eſcape the danger. Let therefore the uſe of Foods be moderate; for as Gluttony is deſtructive, ſo an extraordinary abſtinence is no leſs hurtful:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132688:27"/> He therefore that ſtudies the preſervation of his Health, let him never eat to ſatiety, but ſo, that after Dinner he may perceive ſome relicts of an Appetite remaining; for he that does otherwiſe, ſhall ſuffer all Acids, cholerick Fluxes above and below, a loathing of your Food, a loſs of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, heavineſs of the Head, pain of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Obſtructions of the Liver and the Milt, Diſſentery, or Bloody-flux, and finally, Malignant Fevers.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is better always to leave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Nature; for thoſe which fill themſelves too much, do greatly endanger their Lives, and thereby either the Natural heat is ſuffocated, or ſome Vein is broken; for from too much Food proceed ſeveral Infirmities, and from thoſe Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities Death.</p>
               <p>Obſerve therefore in every thing, but eſpecially in your Diet, this good and laudable Proverb, <hi>viz. Nequid nimis,</hi> Too much of one thing is good for nothing; which ought to be a Maxim not only for the Sick, but alſo for thoſe that are in Health; and the former ought always to obſerve a ſtrict Rule and Meaſure of their Diet, for different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities require different meaſures of Food; for in long and Chronical Diſtempers there is need of a more hearty and large Diet, whereas a more ſlender is requiſite in ſharp and acute Diſtempers, or when the Diſeaſe ſhall be in its height and prime, it is good to uſe an harmleſs and leaſt nouriſhing Food; but we ought always to obſerve how much the ſtrength can bear, and how long it is able to ſubſiſt with this ſort of Food.</p>
               <p>The Quality of the Food, as well in Healthy as in Sick Perſons, is known by the Complexion, the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132688:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> which in the former is to be preſerved by Food of a like temperament; but in the latter, that is, in diſtempered People, Food of a contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is requiſite; ſo that with a moiſt Complexion dry Meats do agree, and on the contrary, moiſt Foods with a dry temperament; and therefore moiſt Foods are convenient for thoſe that are of a moiſt Conſtitution, as Children; or for thoſe that are troubled with ſome dry Diſtemper, to wit, Fevers or Agues. Such Foods therefore are to be choſen, which according to the variety of each Complexion is convenient. Let thoſe of a Sanguine Complexion avoid hot and moiſt Meats, and ſuch as beget much Blood; let Cholerick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhun ſuch Food as produces Choler, and ſo likewiſe the Phlegmatick and Melancholy Men, let them defend themſelves from thoſe things which beget the like Humours; and therefore the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine and Cholerick Men are to abſtain from all ſweet things, as Honey, Sugar, Butter, Oyl, Nuts, and the like; and rather to make uſe of Vinegar, Verjuice, the ſour Juice of Limons, Citrons, and Pomegranats. Moreover, the Food ought not to exceed in any quality; for thoſe which exceed in heat, dry up the Blood, as Sage, Pepper, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Naſturtium, or Water-creſſes, and the like; and if that heat ſhall happen to be watry, as in Melons, it cauſes putrefaction; and if poiſonous, as in the Muſhromes, it often kills a Man; if moiſt, it putrefies, and opilates; and if the heat ſhall be dry, it conſumes and weakens the Body. But if the Food is too cold, it mortifies and congeals, as Lettices, Purſlain, and Cucumbers: The fat and oily Meats looſen the Belly, moiſten and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Flegm, makes over-much ſleep, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132688:28"/> Digeſtion. Sweet Foods cauſe Obſtructions, the bitter do not nouriſh at all, but dry the Blood; the ſalt heat and dry, opilate, and are hurtful to the Stomach; the ſharp by their heat fill the Head, and diſturb the Mind, as Leeks, Garlick, and ſalted Meats: The rough and aſtringent bind and obſtruct, and beget melancholy Blood; the ſharp cauſes Melancholy, hurt ſinewy Members, and therefore do haſten Old Age.</p>
               <p>The Uſe and Cuſtom in our Diet is of great moment, whence the Ancients affirmed, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſus eſt altera Natura,</hi> Cuſtom is a ſecond Nature: Wherefore as in the Food it is good to have reſpect to the Temper; ſo it is no leſs neceſſary to obſerve the Cuſtom, the which is one of the principal Roots and Foundations in the preſervation of the Health, and in the continuation of Infirmities: But here you ought to take notice, that if ſuch a Cuſtom be naught, you ought by little and little to change it into a good one, but a ſudden change is altogether to be avoided, as very dangerous; therefore it is good to accuſtom ones ſelf to every thing, to the end that a ſudden change may not in any wiſe be hurtful.</p>
               <p>The Order alſo is to be obſerved in our Diet; whence Meats eaſie to digeſt, eaſie to go down, and the moſt tender, if they are taken after Meals, ſwim on top, and corrupt. The things of an eaſie Digeſtion are known by the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ility of eating them; and you may conclude them ſuch which are quickly roaſted.</p>
               <p>Such there ought always to precede Food of a contrary quality; that is, of difficult Concoction: And if you have roaſt and boyled Meat together, begin with the boyled, as being the moſt eaſie to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132688:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> be digeſted; and the ſame is to be underſtood of ſoft Eggs and Milk. The things therefore of an eaſie digeſtion, are to be taken before hard, moiſt before dry, liquid before ſolid, and Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives before Aſtringents: All this is meant of a Stomach which is in no wiſe indiſpoſed. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation likewiſe is to be conſidered; for by how much the more pleaſing the Meat is, ſo much the more eaſily 'tis digeſted, and by the Stomach more willingly is received: But you muſt take notice, that you ought not at any time yield that unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Meat ſhould be given to ſick perſons, but you may ſometimes permit them to have a little of ſuch Food as will hurt but little, and ſuch whereof the badneſs may eaſily be corrected.</p>
               <p>The time and ſeaſon to take any Food, is when the Stomach is empty, having quite concocted the precedent Victual; and in the Morning, before the Air grows too hot; and in the Evening, when the Air begins to be leſs hot, but with limitation, that eight hours intervene betwixt one Meal and t'other: And in the Summer you muſt eat in cool Places, and be thinly cloathed, and free from Sweating, but in the Winter the contrary is beſt. Beſides, when you perceive a good Appetite, it is not good long to defer eating; for the abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Food when you are hungry, fills the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach with putrid Humours, becauſe the Stomach at ſuch time as it has an appetite, not receiving any nouriſhment wherewithal to ſuſtain it, does attract the circumjacent Superfluities, filling it ſelf with naughty Humours. The Sick in the time of their Fits ought not to eat any thing. 'Tis alſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to take notice of the time of the Year; for in the Winter, which is cold and moiſt, you ought
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132688:29"/> to eat libera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y, and drink but little, but let the Wine be ſtrong. In the Summer, which is hot and dry, little Food is ſufficient, and very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. In the Spring you muſt eat a little leſs than in Winter, but drink a little more. So in Autumn eat a little more than in Summer, but drink leſs, and leſs Water with your Wine: And therefore to this purpoſe is ſaid;
<q>
                     <l>Temporibus Veris modicè prandere juberis,</l>
                     <l>Sed calor Aeſtatis dapibus nocet immoderatis,</l>
                     <l>Autumni fructus caveas ne ſint tibi luctus,</l>
                     <l>De mensâ ſume quantumvis tempore Brumae.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>In Summer the Food is to be conſidered: To young Children moiſt Victuals beſt agree; but to young men, being hot and dry, the contrary Food is moſt convenient. For old men, ſuch Food as heats is beſt, and moiſtens their ſolid Parts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Children ſhould eat often, to render their natural Heat more ſtrong; but old men ſeldom, their Heat being weak. Infants and Children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more Nouriſhment; but a leſſer quantity is ſufficient for middle-aged and old Men, who can very eaſily undergo Faſting, but young Men hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Children not at all, eſpecially if they be lively and vigorous.</p>
               <p>The Climate likewiſe, or Place of their Growth, is to be conſidered in Foods, <hi>viz.</hi> of Herbs, Fruits, and Fleſh. For Muttons in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> are not very good, but in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are more ſweet, and more wholſom: On the contrary, the fleſh of Veal and of Pidgeons are in <hi>Italy</hi> better than in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> and this proceeds either from a purer Air or ſweeter Soyl in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:132688:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And laſtly, the Nature of each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne, and the particular Propriety, is to be conſidered; and therefore it is neceſſary that the beſt Phyſician be a Philoſopher, for ſome have loathed and abhorred Cheeſe, others Wine, others Garlick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some that are lean, and of an hot and dry Complexion, deſire to eat two or three times a day; others that are fat and moiſt, are content with one Meal a day, for to thoſe that have a fat and big Body, two Meals a day is very hurtful.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe things, it will not be amiſs to obſerve in your Diet theſe following Inſtructions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Eat not to Satiety, for if you ſhould eat more Food than the Stomach is well able to bear, thence proceed infinite Crudities; and therefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to abſtain a little, than to cram your ſelf too full; for as it is written, Gluttony kills more than the Sword; for the ſuperfluous abundance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals ſuffocates the natural Heat, as too great a plenty of Oyl puts out the flame of a Candle; and therefore it is good to riſe from the Table with an Appetite, as it is bad to eat without an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great variety and diverſity of Foods is to be avoided, becauſe they beget many Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, eſpecially if thoſe Foods be of contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for their Concoction is weakned and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and as the variety of Meats delights the Palate, ſo it hurts the Health; whence a wiſe man being asked, Why he contented himſelf with one only diſh of Meat at Meals; replied, Becauſe he would not make work for the Phyſician. So that one ſingle Food at one time is ſufficient and moſt wholeſom, whereas the diverſity of Taſts is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the multitude of Viands moſt pernicious:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:132688:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> And therefore our Anceſtors lived much longer than we, becauſe they never uſed but one ſimple ſort of Food, that is, Bread and Fleſh, whereas we uſing ſo great an abundance of all things, our Life is ſhortned, and expoſed to ſo many Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Do not we ſee the Horſes, the Cows, and other irrational Creatures, how they are troubled but with few Diſeaſes, only by a conſtant uſe of one and the ſame ſort of Food? And therefore a great Philoſopher coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> wondred at two things, That the Men eat twice a day, and that they never ſlept alone.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That being at the Table, you ought not to diſcourſe much, to the end that the time may not be prolonged at the Table, and that the firſt Food may not diſgeſt before the laſt, and ſo the parts of the Food become unequal, whence proceeds Corruption and Putrefaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That you do remain a little while, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Victuals to Victuals, before the firſt be digeſted.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Food be well chewed, for that is ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led the firſt Concoction, and is as it were an half Digeſtion; whereas an imperfect Chewing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and retards Digeſtion: One ought not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſwallow it down whole, as the Gluttons do, but firſt chew it ſufficiently, till it become very ſmall, and then ſwallow it down.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That all hot Meat is better than cold, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Winter, for the actual heat of the Food temperates and allays the coldneſs of the Drink; but you muſt not therefore eat the moſt hot. Hot Meats indeed do moſt pleaſe the Palate, for Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger being a deſire of hot and dry, we always covet hot Food, whereas Thirſt being a deſire of cold and moiſt, it requires cool things.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:132688:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. That in the Winter we uſe groſs Meats, for at that time the natural Heat is more united in the inner Parts; but in the Summer the contrary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and therefore at ſuch time a light and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Food is moſt convenient, the natural Heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then but weak.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the quantity of the Meat be double to that of the Drink, the Bread twice as much as Eggs, thrice as much as Fleſh, and four times as much as Fiſh, Herbs and Fruits.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That you do not uſe Broths too much at Meals, for it cauſes the Food to ſwim in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, looſning and taking away the Appetite, begets too much moiſture, whence afterwards proceed divers Infirmities; whereas thoſe which eat dry Meats, live much longer.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly, Becauſe in Meats and Drinks it is hard to perform every thing exactly, and never to miſtake. Therefore let this be your general Rule, That if at any time you eat naughty Meat, it ought to be tempered and allayed by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

To this Opinion our Uſe and Cuſtom is altogether contrary, chiefly in thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Catarrhs, and Phlegmatick Diſtempers; for at Night the Natural heat, weary and tired by the buſineſſes of the Day, is not ſo ſtrong and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt as in the Morning; and at Night the Food of the Morning is not well concocted.

                  <hi>Name.</hi> IT is called in <hi>Latin, Far;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Maſlin; made of Wheat and Rye, or Wheat and Barley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choice.</hi> The beſt Maſlin is that which is freſh, and very clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quality.</hi> It has the ſame quality as Wheat and Barley; but it is temperate in the firſt Degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> Maſlin is of great Nouriſhment, and therefore eaten with Meat, it nouriſhes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and fattens thoſe that are lean, being more nouriſhing than Barley; and becauſe it is of a groſs nouriſhment, it is good againſt Fluxes and Catarrhs, as well as Rice; but boyled well in fat Broath, it ſoftens the Body. The <hi>Romans</hi> uſed it to make Bread, and it would endure many Years.</p>
               <p>Maſlin is made of Wheat and Rye, putting it to ſteep in Water by little and little, afterwards beat it in a Mortar, and dry it in the Sun, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it thickly grinds, ſo that of one Grain are made four or five parts; and being dry, may be kept a long time, and is of good Nouriſhment, in ſuch manner, that it corrects the vicious and naughty Humours of the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> Being not well boyled and prepared it begets groſs and ſlimy Humours, and is windy, and if eaten by thoſe who have a weak Stomach, it hardly digeſts it ſelf; and therefore it is not good for Old Men, and if uſed too often, it very
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132688:33"/> much opilates and obſtructs the Liver, and cauſes the Gravel in the Kidneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> The hurt of Maſlin is corrected if it be well baked with Vinegar and Garlick; and if it be ſeaſoned with Honey or Sugar, it loſes its clammineſs, and is eaſily digeſted; and being boyled in good Broth, it is an excellent Food for thoſe that are in Health; and for Sick alſo, provided it be moderately eaten. In many places they make Cakes of it, which, if well ſeaſoned, are pleaſant to the taſte, and of great and good Nouriſhment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Name.</hi> IN <hi>Latine</hi> it is called <hi>Triticum;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Wheat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kinds.</hi> There be many ſorts of Wheat, named from their Country, their Colour, their Quality, their Shape, from the quantity of their Ears, and from their largeneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Choice.</hi> The beſt Wheat is that which is through-ripe, thick, and hard, ſo that you can ſcarce break it with your Teeth; and that which grows in fat Ground, free from all mixture, full, heavy, ſmooth, clear, of a Golden colour, and is ripe in leſs than three Months time: That which is gathered in the Mountains is the beſt, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſurpaſſes all the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> It nouriſhes greatly, and its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment is ſolid, and very much ſtrengthens.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132688:33"/> The Flower of Wheat boyled in Milk or Water, with a little Butter, cures the hoarſeneſs of the Throat, leſſens Coughs, is good for thoſe that ſpit Blood, heals the Ulcers in the Breaſt; and in Water with Honey, it mitigates internal Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> It is a little hard and heavy Food to digeſt, breeds ſome groſs and viſcuous Humours; being not well baked, it begets Windineſs, and the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies the Worms in the Belly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> The few ill qualities of the Wheat are corrected, if it be well baked, and ſeaſoned well with good Spices, whereby it becomes leſs windy, and is much more eaſily digeſted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qualities.</hi> Barley is cold and dry in the firſt degree; beſides that, it has ſomething of an aſterſive or cleanſing Nature; its flower is more drying than Bean-flower, and it nouriſhes much leſs than Wheat.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> Barley nouriſhes, and eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it ſelf into fleſh, and is of great uſe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things of Phyſick; it opens the opilations of the Bladder by its abſterſive faculty, and with its other qualities it allays the ſharpneſs of the Humours. Barley-Cakes are of a moiſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive quality; it may fitly be given to feveriſh Perſons, for it extinguiſhes their Thirſt; it is very good for the pains and infirmities of the Breaſt, and an excellent Remedy in Hectick Fevers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of a good and large Nouriſhment; and though it be cold, 'tis nevertheleſs eaſie to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and qualifies the Breaſt, facilitates ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, leſſens the Cough, and cleanſes the Lungs.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> Barley is windy, and Bread made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of begets cold and groſs Humours. Barley-broth ſoon grows ſour; being windy, it does not at all agree with the Stomach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> Barley-broth being carefully boyled together with Hyſſop, Spikenard, or Cinnamon, is leſs windy, and more acceptable to the Stomach, and nouriſhes far better, eſpecially if you add thereto a little Sugar.</p>

               <p>Fine white Bread is quickly digeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> Bread that is not throughly baked, ill kneaded, and without Salt, is very hurtful and unwholſom, eſpecially in ſmoaky Cities. Unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread and Cakes baked under the Aſhes are naughty, for they cauſe Obſtructions, and will

                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> Chich-peaſe are of a great Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, apt to looſen the Belly, and provoke Urine, to beget Milk, and Seed, whence they excite Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, provoke the monthly Courſes; and the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer arietinum</hi> more ſtrongly provokes the Urine than all the reſt, cleanſes the Liver, removes the obſtructions of the Milt, breaks the Stone, cauſes good Colour, contributes to the Lights, purges the Breaſt, clears the Voice, and facilitates Child-birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> Chich-peaſe do indeed nouriſh greatly, but they are windy, and if eaten freſh, or ill boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beget many Superfluities in the Body, and in the Inteſtines, or inward Parts, and are hurtful and very pernicious to the Reins and the Bladder.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> Beans are very nouriſhing, purge the Breaſt, and the Lungs, and therefore are good for the Cough, and make the Voice clear: The Decoction thereof being drunk, hinders the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder; and the Bean by a certain propriety and quality thereof hinders the Diſtillations and Defluxions from falling into the Breaſt, which would cauſe great Coughs; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes

               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> It breeds ſoft and ſpongy Fleſh, having the ſame effects in Fleſh, as Corn in Pyes or Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; it ſwells the Body, begets cholick Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, troubles all the Senſes, renders the Wit groſs and ſtupid, cauſes turbulent Sleeps, and full of trouble.

Beans boyled with Salt, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and Fennel, is very good; as likewiſe if you boyl them with an Onion, or eat that raw with them: If you boyl them without their Husks, with Leeks, adding thereto Saffron, Pepper, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or Cummin; theſe things take away their Windineſs, and do not puff up, but are more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſted.

               <p>
                  <hi>Quality.</hi> The ſweet is hot in the ſecond degree, and dry in the firſt, and the wild heats and dryes more ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> It very much provokes Urine, and Milk, and brings down the Flowers: It removes old Obſtructions, purges the Reins, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contributes to the Eye-ſight; but the dry muſt be uſed in a little quantity, for otherwiſe it will inflame the Liver, and hurt the Eyes; it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Breaſt and the Brain.</p>

                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> It is a ſharp Food, hard of Digeſtion, and of a very bad Nouriſhment: It attenuates and inflames the Blood of ſuch as be cholerick; it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and conſumes the Body, and by the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is begot Melancholy, ſo that it is more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and wholeſom in Phyſick than Food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> The tender is the beſt, and it is to be eaten in a ſmall quantity: The young Fennel which is boyled, is to be open, and put a little while in freſh Water, to take away its naughty and poyſonous quality which the Serpents leave in it. It is good to rub the Eyes withal; but you muſt eat but little thereof, for in time it will breed the Stone, which as being opening carries groſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the ſtraight paſſages of the Urine, where
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:132688:47"/> they afterwards condenſe, and become Stones and Gravels.</p>

The Garden-Burnet is a ſingular Remedy againſt the Plague, as likewiſe the Wild; and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that my Father (who beſides his other Sciences, had no mean skill in Simples) told me often-times that in the laſt great Plague which ſo infeſted all <hi>Italy,</hi> that with the Decoction of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net only, infuſed into Wine, and with Bole-armoniack, he preſerved both himſelf and his Family in good Health.

Though it be true, that their uſe is more frequent in Phyſick than in Food; for they have almoſt all a naughty Juice, and are hard to be digeſted. Thoſe Roots may be ſecurely eaten which grow in the Garden, and are of a young, freſh, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plant. The Roots have two parts, the skin and the wooden parts, and in ſome the peel is beſt: The outward part is more hot than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; ſo that in cold Roots, the out-ſide is the beſt; as in the hot Roots, the in-ſide; eſpecially if they be not woody.

               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> Being eaten in Food, it is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt all Poiſon; and therefore is called the Country-mans Treacle: It kills and drives the Worms out of the Body, provokes Urine, is good for the biting of Serpents, very uſeful for Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Tiſical Men, and makes the voice good. It corrects the hurt which the change of Air or Water may cauſe, and temperates the coldneſs and moiſtneſs of Sallads. Garlick is exceeding good for Sea-men, for it purifies the Air, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the ſtink of Tar and Pitch, and helps Sea-ſick Perſons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Agliata</hi> (a ſort of Food amongſt the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>) is made of Garlick, Nuts, Salt, and Bread, with two leaves of Sage; which is very pleaſant to the Palat and Stomach, and excites the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</p>

                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> It hurts the expulſive faculties, the Head, the Brain, and the Eye-ſight; it cauſes thirſt, is naught for big-bellied Women, renews old pains, dries up and burns the Blood, hurts the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods, or Piles, and Women that give ſuck; it cauſes a noyſom and ſtinking Breath. 'Tis a ſharp Food, and offends the Liver, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Foundation of the Health; and when the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſprouts, it is more hurtful, for that is a ſign of putrefaction.</p>

                  <p n="5">V. That aſtringent Fruits taken before, bind the Belly; whereas, taken after, they looſen the Belly.</p>

                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> They lenifie the roughneſs of the Throat, quench the Thirſt, and make the Body ſlippery, excite the Appetite, extinguiſh the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; being eaten before Meat, they are quickly digeſted, but eaten after, they are as ſoon cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; which alſo happens, if they find in the Stomach any naughty Humours.</p>

The ſame thing is no leſs expedient for the Bitings of mad Dogs, ſpreading a little thereof upon a Plaiſter, and applying it to the Sore; the green bark of the Nut may ſupply the place of Pepper in Meat. The uſe of Walnuts is very laudable and wholeſom after that you have eaten any Fiſh, for they cut and take away the ſlimyneſs thereof; whence is ſaid:

               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> They are called <hi>Nuces, quaſi Noces, quia nocent,</hi> becauſe they hurt the Throat, the Tongue, and the Palate; for being eaten in too great a quantity, chiefly the dry, excite the Cough, cauſe the Head-ach, beget Crudities, the Vertigo, and Thirſt. The ſhade of a Nut-tree is very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for it ſends forth a naughty Vapour and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, which makes the Head heavy, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends thoſe that ſleep under it, and with its deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive odour penetrates the Brain; and therefore being planted near the High-way, ſhe thus heavily complains, and bewails her hard lot, as the Poet deſcribes it:

               <p>
                  <hi>Qualities.</hi> They are cold in the firſt degree, and dry in the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> They are very pleaſant to the taſte, extinguiſh the heat and ſharpneſs of the Blood, and refreſhing the Liver, they quench the burning Choler, take away Thirſt, provoke the Urine, and excite the Appetite. Their Wine dries up the fluxes and rheums of the Eyes, and clear the Sight, applyed to the Eyes, taking away the little Clouds of the Eyes, and cleanſe the Eyes hurt by the Small-Pox. The Straw-berries do not receive any venomous quality from the Toads
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:132688:78"/> and Serpents, though they often tread upon and paſs over them, as being of a very low growth; they ſtop Looſneſſes and Flux of Women, and are good for the Milt; the Decoction of the Leaves and Roots drank, eaſes the inflammation of the Liver, and cleanſes the Kidney and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the Water of Straw-berries diſtilled, ſtops the Bloody-flux in all parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> They are of little Nouriſhment, and are eaſily corrupted in the Stomach: Straw-berries are very hurtful to trembling and Paralitick Men, and thoſe that are troubled with convulſions of the Nerves; their Wine intoxicates, they eaſily putrifie; whence thoſe that eat many of them, fall often-times into Malignant Fevers.</p>

                  <head>Advertiſements concerning Fleſh.</head>
                  <p>FLeſh is more nouriſhing than all other Food; for being hot and moiſt, it is eaſily turned into Blood, and afford great Nouriſhment; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which it will be good to obſerve theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. You muſt always take notice, That Fleſh, Herbs, Fruits, Corn, and Wine are to be choſen in high and odoriferous places, ſuch as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with wholſom Winds, and recreated with the warm beams of the Sun, where there are no Ponds, Lakes, and ſtanding Waters, for in ſuch pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ces they are quickly corrupted.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That the fleſh of all thoſe Creatures which live in Fens, Marſhes, and ſtanding Pools, be avoided; to wit, of Ducks and Geeſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The fleſh of Creatures too Old, are naught, hard, dry, ſinewy, of ſmall Nouriſhment, and hard to be digeſted; whereas on the other ſide, ſuch as are too Young do over-abound with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and are full of ſuperfluities, though more eaſily concocted in the Stomach.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The fleſh of the Male Animal is more hot and dry, and more eaſily digeſted than that of the Female, the which is more cold and moiſt, and for that cauſe leſs digeſtible; yet the fleſh of the Female is better for feveriſh Perſons than the other, becauſe it is leſs hot and more moiſt; and therefore in Summer, to ſick Perſons you muſt give young Pullets, and not Cockerels.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:132688:79"/>V. All Female fleſh begets worſe Blood than the Male, except that of the She-Goat, which affords better Nouriſhment than that of the Male.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Salted fleſh is hurtful, begetting groſs and melancholick Blood, and bad Juice; for it dries much, and nouriſhes little.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Fat Meat is eaſily digeſted, yet breeds many ſuperfluities, and therefore is of ſmall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, takes away the Appetite, hinders the Digeſtion, and makes the Stomach languiſh: The lean nouriſhes better, and begets fewer ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; whence the middling betwixt both is more wholſom, becauſe it breeds temperate Blood.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. The fleſh of Birds is more light, more dry, and more eaſily digeſted, than that of four-footed Beaſts; and therefore more convenient and agreeable for thoſe who are more given to the exerciſe of the Mind, than of the Body, for they are digeſted more eaſily than all the reſt, and becauſe they breed Blood which is clear, clean, and full of Spirits, and fit for the exerciſe of the Mind.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. The fleſh of wild Creatures, and ſuch as frequent the Woods, is better than that of tame; and the Blood which is bred by eating of them will have fewer ſuperfluities, by reaſon of the much running, and exerciſe which they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to, and becauſe they live in a more dry Air, eſpecially ſuch as frequent the Mountains, and their fleſh will keep longer uncorrupted; for they have leſs fat, and therefore beget fewer ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, nouriſh better, and breed a more ſound Blood: But tame Creatures are more moiſt than wild, by reaſon of their little motion, and the moiſtneſs of the Air wherein they live.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:132688:80"/>X. In moiſt times and complexions the fleſh that inclines to dryneſs is moſt convenient; and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. The fleſh of gelded Creatures is the beſt, as being moſt temperate; for 'tis hotter than the Female, and colder than the Male.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. The fleſh of black Creatures is more light and ſweet than that of the white.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. The fleſh which ſticks to the Bone, is of beſt Nouriſhment; and the fleſh of the right ſide is better than the left, and the fore-part is better than the hinder; for the fore-part is hotter, and more eaſily digeſted, but the hinder-part is colder, and more groſs; the fleſh which is near the Heart is better than the other farther off; for being ſtrengthened by the heat of the Heart, 'tis more fit to nouriſh.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. The fleſh which is dry muſt be boyled, the moiſt roaſted.</p>
                  <p n="15">XV. Roaſted fleſh is fatter, of greater Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though more hardly digeſted than boyled, which though of leſs, yet is of better Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore more wholſom; at Dinner boyled Meats are beſt, at Supper roaſted, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an harder digeſtion, and therefore better concocted in the Night-time. Fryed and broyled Meats beget nauſeous Humours and Crudities in the Stomach, and are of a difficult digeſtion, though very nouriſhing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Qualities.</hi> The Lamb is moiſt in the ſecond degree, and hot in the firſt; but the ſucking-Lamb is moiſt in the third degree, and is very viſcuous; but when 'tis a year old, though it abounds with moiſtneſs, yet being taken from Milk, the heat increaſes, and the moiſture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> The fleſh of the young ones is a very laudable Food, and of good Nouriſhment. The Horns of a Stag burned drive away all Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Creatures; and the Bone which is found in their Heart is very Cordlal, and a good Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt Poiſon, and therefore uſed in Treacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> This fleſh breeds groſs and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humours, hard of digeſtion, nouriſhes little, cauſes Palſies, Tremblings, and Quartan Agues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> Boyling it together with the Heads of other groſs Animals, or baking it in Paſties, but let it be young, or gelded, and it is not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: 'Tis not to be eaten in Summer, chiefly by Old and Melancholick Men, in Winter more
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:132688:83"/> ſecurely; for in Summer they feed on Vipers and Serpents. The Hanches are the beſt part.</p>

                     </label> LET the Head be of a temperate Creature, of a moderate Age and Complexion: That of a Kid is of better and greater Nouriſhment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Urine, looſens the Belly, and excites vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Deſires; but eating too much thereof, it thickens the ſubtil Humours, and breeds groſs; it burdens the Stomach, becauſe it is not eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and will hardly go down, unleſs eaten with ſtrong Muſtard, and other Aromatick things. The Head is hot in the firſt degree, and moiſt in the ſecond, and in cold weather very good for young and cholerick men.</p>

                     </label> ALL Brains hurt the Stomach, and induce Nauſeating; are a flegmatick Food, of groſs Nouriſhment, hard Digeſtion; but ſeaſoned with Spices, and Aromatick things, it becomes better: The Brains of Birds, eſpecially of wild Fowl, are very good, eaten with Orice, Pepper and Vinegar, to take away their moiſt Humours.</p>

                     <label>IX. <hi>The Liver.</hi>
                     </label> THE Liver of all four-footed Creatures is very bad Food, for it is not eaſily digeſted it ſelf, and hinders the digeſtion of other Food: It wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and burdens the Stomach; but if the Beaſt be fed with dryed Figs before it is killed, and if it be a Male and young, its Liver is a delicate Food, nouriſhing the Body exceeding well; and is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly good for them who in the Dusk cannot ſee at all; ſuch is that of the Gooſe fatned with Milk, or of a fat Hen. The hurt of the Liver is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by boyling it well, until the blood which is within it be conſumed; and let it be boyled with Sage and Laurel, afterwards wrapped up with the Gizard, and when it is throughly boyled, let the ſawce be the juyce of Oranges. The Livers of Hens and Capons are the beſt; that of a Kid is next; then that of a Gooſe; and laſtly, the Liver of an Hog. The Liver is good at all times, for

                  <p>
                     <label>XI. <hi>The Milt.</hi>
                     </label> THE Milt is very pleaſant to the taſte, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a certain ſharpneſs which it contains within it ſelf, but is of a bad nouriſhment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a receptacle of melancholick Humours, it makes thoſe who eat too much of it, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>

                     <label>XII. <hi>The Kidneys.</hi>
                     </label> THE Kidneys nouriſh badly, digeſt worſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of old Creatures; but of young ones, and of thoſe that ſuck, as young tender Pigs, and Kids, they are better.</p>

                     <label>XIII. <hi>The Tripe.</hi>
                     </label> THE Tripe is good for ſuch as labour and tire their Bodies, for it is harder than the fleſh of its Creature: It is cold and dry in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; 'tis good for thoſe that are troubled with great Heat in the Stomach and Belly, becauſe it breeds cold Humours; it hurts them that have the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:132688:88"/> Scurf, the Leproſie, and other melancholick Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. The beſt is that of a fat Beaſt, killed in the flower of its Age, well fed, and clean; let it be a long time boyling in fat Broath, with Mint and Spices enough; 'tis not good, unleſs in cold weather, for young men that work hard, of a ſtrong Stomach, and hot Conſtitution. The Kids-Tripes challenge the Superiority; Calves-Tripes claim the next place; and Ox-Tripes the laſt.</p>

                     <label>XIV. <hi>The Spleen.</hi>
                     </label> THE Spleen, as it is the receptacle of groſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Blood, affords little Nouriſhment, and is hardly concocted, therefore not fit for Food.</p>
                  <p>

                     </label> THE Inteſtines affords not very good, but thick Aliment; and the Bowels of younger Quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peds, as Calves are of better juyce, and more eaſily concocted, than of old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XVI. <hi>The Teſticles.</hi>
                     </label> THE ſubſtance of the Teſticles or Stones is like that of the Udder: They afford an excellent Nouriſhment to the Body, multiplying the Seed, and increaſing Copulation; thoſe of fatted Cocks and Cockrels are pleaſant to the Taſte, of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and great Nouriſhment; for 'tis ſaid, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nutriunt, quantum ponderant.</hi> The Stones of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:132688:88"/> old Creatures are of a ſlow Digeſtion, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what preſs the Stomach; but firſt boyling them with Mountain Penny-royal and Salt, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards frying them with freſh Butter, whereby they are leſs hurtful: They are good in cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all Ages and Complexions, except decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit and flegmatick men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>XVII. <hi>The Feet.</hi>
                     </label> THE Feet of Beaſts are better than thoſe of Birds, for by reaſon of their continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are more eaſily digeſted, but beget groſs and viſcuous Humours; they are to be eaten at firſt Courſe. The Feet of Birds are no good Food; but Kids, Lambs, Calves-Feet, and other young Creatures which run much, are good for chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick men, and ſuch as have a thin Blood, cauſe Sleep, nouriſh much, ſoder the broken Veins in the Breaſt and Lungs, cure Tiſical Diſtempers, and excite the Appetite, hurt thoſe that are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Wind, the Gout, Pains in the Joynts, and the Sciatica: They are good at all times for young and cholerick, though naught for old and gouty perſons; but boyling them till they be ſoft, and then preparing them with Vinegar and Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, takes away all their ill.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quality.</hi> The Freſh Cheeſe is cold and moiſt in the ſecond degree, but the old is hot and dry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> The Freſh mollifies and fattens the Body, is pleaſant to the Taſte, and not hurtful to the Stomach, and of all other Cheeſes is moſt dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible, but let it not be hard Curd. The Cream Cheeſe is moſt wholeſom, but it muſt be eaten the ſame day on which it was made. Cheeſe is only to be eaten, to ſhut up and cloſe the mouth of the Stomach; and we muſt beware we eat not too much thereof, eſpecially of old Cheeſe, which if eaten in too great a quantity, is very pernicious: And therefore this Rule is to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <head>Advertiſements concerning Birds.</head>
                  <p>THE different Nature of Birds is diſcerned from the Time, the Age, the Food, the Place, the Air, and from being gelded. You muſt therefore diligently obſerve theſe four things: And firſt,</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:132688:91"/>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Time.</label> Becauſe at ſuch Time as Birds couple, as well domeſtick as wild Fowl, they thereby grow lean, and feed little; the which is manifeſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in tame Fowl: Hens in the Winter after they are trod, do fatten ſufficiently, and become tender; ſome Birds are better in Summer, at which time they eat the Corn; others in Autumn, becauſe they eat Grapes, Figs, Apples, Berries, and ſuch like Fruit; other Birds are more acceptable in Winter, as Thruſhes, Black-birds, Wild-geeſe, Cranes, and all Water-fowl. Secondly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Victuals.</label> For ſome feed on Fleſh; as Eagles, Vultures, Kites; and others that have crooked Tallons, as feeding on Carrion, are not eaten by us; ſome live on Worms, but moſt eat Corn, as Pidgeons, Doves, Turtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſhort, ſome are nouriſht on Land, others in Rivers; ſome in Lakes, and others in the Sea; and there is no ſmall number of Birds which feed on Herbs: And 'tis obſervable, that beſides this, the fleſh of wild Fowls have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the taſte of ſuch things as the Birds feed on, as of Ants, of Worms, of Fiſh, of Slime, and of Mud. Thirdly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Place.</label> Mountain-Fowl are always to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reſt, before tame Fowl, and ſuch as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Marſhes, Fens, and Lakes: For according to the variety of the Place, the fleſh is varied and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:132688:92"/> changed; as ſometimes to be dry, of few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and eaſily digeſted; or moiſt, full of Excrements, and of a difficult concoction, which does often happen in the ſame Bird. Beſides, gelding or cutting a Fowl, makes it fat and ſweet, as appears in the fleſh of Capons. Fourthly, and Laſtly,</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>The Age.</label> For the fleſh of young Birds is always better than that of old, which is hard, dry, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly digeſted, and of ſmall nouriſhment. But now let us proceed in particular to the fleſh of Birds which are uſed for Food.</p>

                  <head>Advertiſements concerning Fiſh.</head>
                  <p>THE Fiſh in reſpect of Fleſh are of a leſs nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, but groſs, flegmatick, cold, and full of Superfluities; the old nouriſh more than the young, and thoſe that live amongſt Stones and Rocks are the beſt. Fiſh are of an hard Digeſtion, and the ſign of their Indigeſtion is Thirſt, ſeeing that they all cauſe Thirſt, if they remain long time in the Stomach, nay ſometimes they corrupt. Concerning Fiſh you may obſerve theſe following Rules:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That all Fiſh ſhould be eaten hot, and not cold.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That you muſt not ſtuff your ſelf too full of any ſort of Fiſh, but eat leſs thereof than of Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That you muſt not eat them too often, and when you uſe them, they are to be eaten with Aniſe-ſeed, Fennel, and other Spices, whereby in ſome ſort to dry up their moiſtneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That you do not eat Fiſh after great Labour and Exerciſe, for then they eaſily corrupt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may you eat Fiſh after other Food: Thoſe that have a weak Stomach, and full of bad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, may eat no ſort of Fiſh; therefore they may not be given to old men, and ſuch as are not healthy, for they do rather diminiſh, than increaſe the natural Heat.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:132688:101"/>V. Fiſh and Fleſh at the ſame Table are to be forbidden: Likewiſe Fiſh and Milk, or any thing belonging thereunto, for they breed many naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſtempers; no leſs inconvenient are Eggs.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. That great and viſcuous Fiſh pickled and ſalted, are ſomething better than freſh, and leſs hurtful, but let them not be too ſalt, for the Salt is very offenſive to the Brain: The freſh Fiſh beget watry Flegm, ſoften the Nerves, and are only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for hot Stomachs; the ſalted and ſeaſoned Fiſh are not ſo moiſt, and therefore better; the dry are of a bad nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. You muſt alſo obſerve, that the clearer and deeper the Water is, the better are the Fiſh that are nouriſhed therein.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. That the maritime Fiſh are more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom than the freſh Water Fiſh, being more hot, and leſs moiſt, and their nouriſhment draws near to Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. Amongſt the Sea and River-Fiſh, thoſe are moſt commendable which live in rocky Places; next to theſe, in ſandy Places, in ſweet, clear, and running Waters, where there is no filth; but thoſe Fiſh are naught which live in Pools, Lakes, Marſhes, Fens, and in any ſtill or muddy Water.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. That amongſt all the Fiſh, both in the Sea and Rivers, thoſe which are not too big, are the beſt, and which have not an hard and dry Fleſh, without any fatneſs or ſlimyneſs, or naughty taſte, or ſmell, not viſcuous, but criſp and tender, not apt to corrupt, but that will keep a long while, and ſuch as have many Fins and Scales.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Fiſh are cold and moiſt, and therefore naught for cold Complexions, though they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Milk, and Seed, and are very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for cholerick men.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:132688:102"/>XII. The beſt way of dreſſing and preparing Fiſh, is to broyl it over the Goals, or Gridiron; to boyl it is the next way, and to fry it is the worſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, eſpecially for ſuch as have a weak Stomach. The roaſted Fiſh are better than the boyled, and the boyled better than the fryed; but you muſt take notice, that the roaſted Fiſh muſt not be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to the end that their Vapours may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled.</p>

                  <hi>Choice.</hi> The beſt is the clear, pure, and ſubtil Water, free from all taſtes; and that is the beſt, which being ſet on the fire, is eaſily heated, and taken thence, is ſoon cool: In the Summer let it be cool, in Winter warm; let it neither be ſalt nor bitter, nor taſte of Mud, Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor any Mineral Waters. Let its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be ſituate towards the Eaſt, and run to the North: The Water which runs on pure Earth is better than ſuch as runs upon Stones; you muſt take care that it be not heavy, nor burdenſome to the Stomach, but light, and quickly digeſted. On the contrary, thoſe Waters are naught which run from Marſhy places, which have any ill ſmell, or participate of Minerals; as alſo are Snow-waters, and Ice diſſolv'd; and likewiſe ſuch as in Winter are cold, in Summer hot, for all ſuch cool the Stomach, and obſtruct the Milt.</p>

                  <hi>Commodity.</hi> It is good for hot, fat, and fleſhy Men, and mixt with Wine for ſuch as uſe much Labour and Exerciſe. And though this does not nouriſh, yet it refreſhes, and reſtores the ſtrength, and is the conduct of the Food, excites the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; and oportunely given in burning Fevers, it produces a joyful and happy ſucceſs; for it is moſt contrary, and diſagreeing with the Nature of Fevers, refreſhing and moiſtening the Body: It
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:132688:115"/> does likewiſe very much contribute to Nightly Diſtempers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hurt.</hi> It is bad for ſuch as are too hot, lean, and idle Men, and ſuch as unaccuſtomed to drink it; ſuch as have a weak Stomach, and are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Convulſion of the Nerves. It hurts the Teeth, the Breaſt, and weak Entrails; the drinking of freſh Water is bad for Old Men; and thoſe that uſe it too frequently, will inevitably fall into Old Age, and cold Infirmities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remedy.</hi> The Malignity of Water is corrected by beaten Pepper; and if you would drink it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, you muſt put therein Aniſe-ſeed; and for ſick Men boyl therewith Cinnamon, and ſuch like things: Elſe make Honey-water, or Methe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glin, which has great Vertues, takes away Thirſt, cures the cold Infirmities of the Brain, Nerves, and Joints, is good againſt the Cough, cuts and expels groſs Flegm from the Breaſt and Stomach, moves the Body and the Entrails, purges the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and paſſages of the Urine, and therefore is good againſt Cholick-pains.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Advertiſements in the Choice of Wines.</head>
                  <p>WIne is reckoned amongſt Food, becauſe every thing that nouriſhes is Food; and amongſt all the Liquors we drink, Wine may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claim the Superiority, for it is more wholeſom, and by reaſon of its ſubtil and penetrating ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it mixes better with the Maſs than does the Water, and other Drinks: Beſides, that it is moſt pleaſant and grateful to the Palate, it reſtores
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:132688:116"/> the radical Moiſture, and chears the Heart. Wine is a moſt ſweet Liquor, and an excellent reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all the Faculties, and is the moſt certain prop and maintenance of our Life; and therefore our Anceſtors called the Tree <hi>Vitis, quaſi Vita,</hi> as if it were the Tree of Life: But the uſe thereof is to be regulated by theſe twelve following Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That when the Wine is ſtrong and full of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, you muſt always mix Water therewith, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple Water, or elſe the decoction of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, or prepared Coriander, and with it mingle ſo much Water, as may ſuffice to take away the Heat and Evaporation which gets into the Head: And becauſe you may make a better mixture, and the hot parts of the Wine may be cooled, mix it an hour before you drink it; but if the Wine be ſmall and wateriſh, do not mix it, for it moiſtens the Body too much, and cauſes Windineſs in the Entrails, and intoxicates more eaſily; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as have a weak Stomach ſhould omit this.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That you never drink Wine after Dinner or Supper, until the concoction of the Food be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for then it helps Nouriſhment, penetrating more eaſily the Body, whereas at firſt it would hinder Digeſtion.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. You muſt have a care that you do not drink Wine cooled with Snow, or icy Water; for it is very pernicious to the Brains, Sinews, Breaſt, Lungs, Stomach, to the Entrails, the Milt, Liver, Kidneys, Bladder, and cauſes Wind; whence it is no wonder, that ſuch as uſe Wine in Snow or Ice, are troubled with Cholick pains, Infirmities of the Stomach, ſtoppage of Urine, and other
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:132688:116"/> pernicious Evils; whereas the ancient <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eks</hi> were wont to drink it hot, with good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. You muſt avoid drinking Wine faſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it troubles the Underſtanding, induces the Cramp, is exceeding hurtful to the Brain and Nerves, fills the Head, whence proceed Catarrhs; which is ſeen by experience in the old <hi>Turks,</hi> who drinking no Wine, are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t much troubled with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs or Tooth-ach, whereas we who uſe it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, begin to perceive Rheums and Catarrhs in our Youth: Therefore when you find that the Wine has offended your Head, and cauſes Pains therein, immediately provoke Vomiting.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. That it is not convenient after freſh and moiſt Fruit to drink a thin Wine, for the Wine being a good Penetrator, does preſently induce and lay open a paſſage to the Members for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of this Fruit: But this is to be underſtood, if you drink a ſuperfluous quantity thereof; but if you drink it moderately, it corrects the hurt of all ſuch Food.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. If at the ſame Table, both ſmall and ſtrong Wine is uſed, begin with the ſmall, reſerving the ſtrong for the laſt, which comforts the mouth of the Stomach, and helps Digeſtion.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. That by how much the Food is more cold and groſs, ſo much the more need is there of ſtrong Wine; but when the Food is more ſubtil, hot and digeſtible, let the Wine be weak; and therefore ſuch as feed on Beef and Fiſh, are to drink ſtronger Wine than ſuch as feed on Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. That ſuch as uſe much Wine, ought not to eat much, for Wine ſerves inſtead of Meat and Drink, and therefore Nature cannot eaſily digeſt them both.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:132688:117"/>IX. Wine that is weakned with Water, is more wholeſom and commendable than that which is naturally weak, for the latter more eaſily putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. That ſuch as have a weak Brain, a hot Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Stomach, and dwell in ſultry Countreys, ought to drink a little Wine, mixing Water there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but if cold, the more Wine and leſs Water will not be amiſs.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. You muſt alſo obſerve the ſeaſon of the Year; for in Winter, drink very ſparingly, but ſtrong Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Summer, more largely, but ſmall, and mixt with Water.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. You muſt moreover conſider the Age; for as Wine is very bad for Children, ſo it is moſt proper for old men, ſeeing that it qualifies and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays their cold Complexion: And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> denies Wine to Children, gives young men leave to drink it moderately, and allows old men a more plentiful uſe thereof, ſaying, that Children before they are twenty two years old, ought not to drink any Wine, becauſe that will add fire to their fire, and young men ought not to drink it ſtrong, but well tempered.</p>

                  <head>The Qualifications of Good Wine.</head>
                  <p>GOod Wine ought to be clean, pure, and clear, inclining to a red, called Claret, or Cherry-colour; but let it be of ſtony and mountainous Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſituate towards the South: Let it be of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Odour, for ſuch Wine increaſes the ſubtil Spirits, nouriſhes excellently, and breeds very good Blood; let it be of a pleaſant Taſte, but let
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:132688:117"/> it by no means be too ſharp or ſweet, but of a middle temper, for if too ſweet, it inflames, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs, and fills the Head, but the ſharp or ſowr Wine hurts the Nerves and Stomach, and begets Crudities.</p>

Then as to the Body; it is very nouriſhing, reſiſts Putrefaction, helps Digeſtion, and breeds good Blood, cuts Flegm, diſſolves Windineſs, provokes Sleep, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the Appetite, fattens healthy men, reſtores conſumptive men, opens Obſtructions, concocts crude Humours, provokes Sleep, opens a paſſage for the Superfluities; whence Wine was juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Ancients, <hi>Theriaca magna,</hi> ſince that it heats all cold Tempers, and refreſhes hot, as alſo it dryes the moiſt Tempers, and moiſtens the dry.</p>
